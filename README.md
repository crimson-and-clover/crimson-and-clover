## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was previously a NetEaser, and I am currently pursuing my M.Phil. degree at HKUST(GZ).

My research interests include large language models (LLMs), scene reconstruction, and multimodal learning.

If you are interested in collaborating with me, feel free to reach out via email: yhu847@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn.

I am currently developing a VSCode extension for visualizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

You are welcome to sponsor me to help support and motivate my work!
